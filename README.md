# Machine Learning Projects Repository

Welcome to my machine learning projects repository. This repository showcases my skills and expertise in the field of machine learning, specifically in time series forecasting and DDoS detection and classification. Each project is designed to demonstrate my understanding of the underlying concepts, data preprocessing, model development, and evaluation techniques.

## üìà Time Series Forecasting

### Project Description

The project utilizes historical Bitcoin data to predict its price, encompassing stages of data preprocessing, feature manipulation, and training and assessing models. Diverse model structures, comprising DNN, CNN, LSTM models, and the N-BEATS design, are put into action and compare in terms of their effectiveness. The project also illustrates methods like combining multiple models and making predictions about upcoming Bitcoin prices.

## üë®üèª‚Äçüíª DDoS Detection and Classification

### Project Description

The DDoS detection project aimed to create a machine learning model capable of identifying Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks in a network. The project also categorize the specific type of DDoS attack being launched..
