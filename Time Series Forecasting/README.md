# 💰📈 Bitcoin Prediction with Tensorflow

In this notebook. I will showcase my ability to make time-series predictions using Tensorflow. I builds 8 model from the simple one until complex model (N-BEATS Algorithm) and Ensemble model.

The N-BEATS algorithm focuses on univariate time series problems and achieved state-of-the-art performance in the winner of the M4 competition (a forecasting competition).
